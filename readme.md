## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of various data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Each implementation is accompanied by unit tests to ensure correctness and to provide a hands-on approach to learning and understanding DSA.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for implementing data structures and algorithms.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript testing framework used for writing and running tests.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManishPJha/js-dsa.git
   cd js-dsa
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute all the test cases using Jest and display the results in the terminal.
